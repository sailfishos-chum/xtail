Description: |
    xtail watches the growth of files.

    It's like running a "tail -f" on a bunch of files at once.

    You can specify both filenames and directories on the command line.

    If you specify a directory, it watches all the files in that directory.  It
    will notice when new files are created (and start watching them) or when old
    files are deleted (and stop watching them).

    === HISTORICAL NOTES ===

    This program is an oldie but goodie.  It was posted to comp.sources.misc
    in July 1989 (see ftp.uu.net:/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume7/xtail.Z).
    I remember posting an even earlier version to alt.sources.  It has been
    published in the O'Reilly & Associates "Unix Power Tools" collection
    (book and CD-ROM).

    Over the years, some fly-by-night organizations (such as the MIT X
    Consortium and SGI) have tried to steal the "xtail" name.  Don't be
    fooled!  Insist on the original.

    The 1989 release credited David Dykstra for his contributions.
